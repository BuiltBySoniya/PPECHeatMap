üß† AI-Powered Zip-Code Expansion Strategy ‚Äî PPEC of Palm Beach
üåç Overview

This project builds an AI-driven geographic expansion model for Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care (PPEC) of Palm Beach, which had reached capacity.
Using public-health and socioeconomic data, I designed a zip-code-level clustering framework to identify underserved families, forecast demand, and guide resource allocation for ethical, data-backed growth.

üß© Problem Statement

PPEC centers faced the challenge of expanding without compromising care quality.
Leadership needed a scalable, data-backed approach to answer three core questions:

Where are the highest-need pediatric populations?

Which areas should be prioritized for outreach and facility expansion?

How can resources (staff, transport, funding) be allocated most effectively?

üîç Approach
 1> Data Collection + Integration

Gathered multi-source public data at the zip-code level, including:

Child population density

Household income levels

Medicaid % and insurance coverage

Distance to existing PPEC centers

2> AI Clustering & Modeling

Applied K-Means clustering to segment Florida zip codes by opportunity.

Categorized zones into üü¢ High, üü† Moderate, and üî¥ Low potential.

Used statistical weighting to combine socioeconomic and access variables.

3> Visualization & Mapping

Built an interactive Folium heatmap to display geographic clusters.

Integrated color-coded opportunity overlays for executive review.

Automated data refresh through AWS Lambda + S3 pipelines.

4> Insights & Recommendations

>>> Generated five actionable insights:

>Zip codes 33413, 33415 & 33417 = high potential, low service.

>‚ÄúWhite space‚Äù zones have high Medicaid coverage but no centers.

>AI clustering supports franchise targeting, not just new builds.

>Zip-level precision enables hyperlocal marketing ROI.

>Resource load can be optimized by zone priority.

5> Strategy Framework

Developed two implementation tracks:

Resource Allocation Plan: Grouped zip codes into High/Moderate/Low priority for staffing & outreach.

White Space Zone Playbook: Identified untapped regions ideal for mobile PPEC units and school partnerships.
